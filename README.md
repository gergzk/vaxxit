A model of how vaccination choices may affect populations.

The goal of this project is to explore a number models:
1. How people choose to engage or avoid each other (eg: social distancing)
2. How people leave contagious material around while infected (eg: cloud of droplets)
3. How vaccination rates (and efficacy) play out in viral spread in a population
4. A visualization and controls for the above
5. Let people play with what-ifs and get some intuitive sense for the overall effect of different choices.

We could get arbitrarily fancy with people motion, such as modeling the need to get groceries, etc, but that may be overkill. A basic mobility and distancing model may be enough and further details might not be usefully illustrative (eg: more dials, but no real value).
